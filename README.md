# WhatsOn-Android-App
An android app named What's On created to retrieve and display all of the events going on at the University of Essex

What's On is created in a mix of java and XML. Java runs the backend of the system making sure the app does what its intended to do and completes the actions requested from the user. The XMl is responsible for most of what you see when you use the app. It is responsible for the user interface and the way the app looks. One of the main features of the app is the web scraper that retrieves all of the data used. What's On is created in android studio using additional libraries such as Jsoup and Picaso.  

This is the first app me and my partner have ever produced and so far it is a very innefficient app due to the use of a web scraper which causes it to run a lot slower than it should.
